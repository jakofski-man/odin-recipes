    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the chicken into big pieces. Pat dry and season well with salt, pepper and paprika.</li>
            <li>Heat a large frying pan or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil and a knob of butter. 
            Fry the chicken pieces for 1-2 minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat a little. Add a little more oil, if the pan is dry. Add the onions and fry until soft and shiny. 
            Add garlic, oregano, chili flakes, a splash of tomato paste and sun-dried tomatoes. Let it fry for a minute.</li>
            <li>Add chicken stock and bring to a boil, let it reduce slightly.</li>
            <li>Turn down the heat and stir in the heavy cream and parmesan. Let it simmer for a while, until the sauce thickens. 
            You can also add some spinach, if you like a little extra green. Let it cook a little in the sauce before continuing.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken back in and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened, about 5-7 minutes. 
            Season with lemon juice and grated lemon zest, a little salt and pepper, and top with basil leaves just before serving.</li>
